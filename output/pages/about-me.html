            <p>I am a research scientist at Facebook. My work centers on understanding the experiences and challenges of marginalized communities and designing and building inclusive and empowering technologies <strong>with</strong> them.</p>
<p>I founded and led the AI for Inclusion initiative in Facebook AI, through which I build AI-powered product experiences to empower and include people from marginalized and under-resourced communities. One example of such experiences is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook">automatic alt-text</a>, a feature I <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/automatic-alt-text-computer-generated-image-descriptions-for-blind-users-on-a-social-network-service/">designed</a> and shipped on Facebook that leverages computer vision to describes images to people with visual impairments. More recently, I worked with people with <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/im-never-happy-with-what-i-write-challenges-and-strategies-of-people-with-dyslexia-on-social-media/">dyslexia</a> to build <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/design-and-evaluation-of-a-social-media-writing-support-tool-for-people-with-dyslexia/">AI-powered writing tools</a> that empower them to express themselves more confidently when writing on social media sites.</p>
<p>Before joining Facebook AI, I was part of Facebook's Core Data Science team where I researched temporal and structural models to study how information and behavior spread in social networks. </p>
<p>My main research interests include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>AI for Empowerment &amp; Equity: Design and develop AI products and experiences that center on the needs of the marginalized. Deliver tangible benefits and reduce the barrier for participation for those who had been under-served and oppressed. 
        - AI &amp; accessibility: How AI technology can be built to augment human capacity and empower people with disabilities to fully participate in and contribute to all aspects of our society without feeling constrained or stagmatized by one's physical or cogntive abilities. And the <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/a-face-recognition-application-for-people-with-visual-impairments-understanding-use-beyond-the-lab/">challenges</a> that come alongs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-centered AI: How can we engage and incentivize the deep learning community to practice and appreciate participatory design and community experience research in the development cycle of AI and stop equivalizing people as labels or embeddings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computational Social Science: How can we understand and improve our socity - especially, the experiences of marginalized communities in our society, through qualitative and quantative research and computational methods? Most of the topics I am interested at - e.g. accessibility, gender inequality, racial justice, literacy - are complex societal challenges with deep sociocultural roots and I do not expect them to be solved by technology alone, however, I do believe that online data can offer us new perspectives and understanding of these challenges that uncover opportunities where technologies and tech platforms can make an meaningful impact. In particular, I am eager to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How marginalized and minority groups form communities and build collective consciousness online.</li>
<li>Where are the <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/visually-impaired-users-on-an-online-social-network/">gaps in online experiences</a> and how are they linked to gaps in offline outcomes for people from different social groups. </li>
<li>How to make informaiton and services accessible for all? Meeting the W3C accessibility standards is the first step but also a minimal requirement, we need to both empower people with knowledge and tools but also design information systems that meet people with their indivisualized needs. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am a big fan of mixed methodology and embrace both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My current research takes place at the intersection of AI and HCI, as I believe AI research should be user/problem oriented rather than technology oriented.</p>
<p>I publish my work at CHI, theWebConf (formerly known as WWW), CSCW, and ICWSM. I frequently review papers and serve in the organization committee for journals and conferences as well.</p>
