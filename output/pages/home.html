            <p>I'm Shaomei. I study and build technologies that empower people from marginalized communities and dismantle barriers for all. My current work takes place at the intersetion of AI, HCI, Accessibility, and Social Computing, and orient itself to the needs of those who have been historically marginalized or underserved. In particular, I explore the following two connected domains:</p>
<!-- I am interested at understanding the **experiences and challenges of marginalized communities** and building **inclusive** and **empowering** technologies **with the community**.-->

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand marginalized populations and their experiences online and offline</strong>.</p>
<p>I work closely with people from different communities (e.g. people with disabilities, people with literacy challenges, 
and people experiencing racial injustice) to understand margainlized experiences online as well the impact 
of such experiences offline. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methodology, I study the 
<em>challenges</em> and <em>capacities</em> of marginalized communities, and identify <em>opportunities</em> for technology to make a 
meaningful impact on people’s lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong> - <em>Where are the gaps in technological experiences for marginalized users and how are these gaps linked to offline 
experiences and outcomes</em>? </p>
<p>For example, my research with people with visual impairments 
(<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/visually-impaired-users-on-an-online-social-network/">CHI '14</a>, 
<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/how-blind-people-interact-with-visual-content-on-social-networking-services/">CSCW '16</a>) 
and people with dyslexia (<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/im-never-happy-with-what-i-write-challenges-and-strategies-of-people-with-dyslexia-on-social-media/">ICWSM '18</a>) 
uncovered gaps in their experiences with visual contents and writing on social media, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capacities</strong> - <em>How do marginalized and underserved users leverage and reappropriate mainstream technology to build communities, foster collective consciousness, and coordinate resistance to existing power structures</em>?</p>
<p>I am fascinated by the emergence of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-oral-history-part-i-coming-together/">Black Twitter</a> 
and its role in shaping today's culture and public discourse. My own research also found that people with
disabilities have been using social media platform to share experiences, exchange information, and advocate
for greater awareness of accessibility issues. This has not been a major theme in my current work but is 
something I am personally very invested in and will definitely investigate more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opportunities</strong> - <em>What are the opportunities for current and future technology to close the equity gaps online and offline</em>? </p>
<p>I believe technology has the power to level the playing field and lift up those who were historically left behind.
My partnership with the visually impaired community has greatly informed the design and development of 
image accessibility across the tech industry, from <a href="https://tech.fb.com/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook/">AI-generated alt-text on Facebook/Instagram</a>, 
to custom alt-text on <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/109799/adding-alternative-text-to-images-for-accessibility?lang=en">LinkedIn</a>. 
The impact of such features goes beyond image accessibility, it creates a general sense of empowerment that make 
people with visual impairements feel that <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/automatic-alt-text-computer-generated-image-descriptions-for-blind-users-on-a-social-network-service/">they can <em>enjoy</em> the technologies like everyone else</a>!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design human-centric technology to deliver tangible benefits to marginalized populations</strong>.</p>
<p>Informed by the knowledge I gained from the previous domain, I also do lots of hand-on design &amp; development work  in building innovative technologies  that empower people to overcome barriers and pursue their goals. My tech work falls into the following two areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Make</em> <strong><em>existing</em></strong> <em>technologies inclusive for all</em>.</p>
<p>To build truly inclusive products, I believe the tech community needs to look beyond accessibility requirements, 
and proactively design creative solutions to reduce both the technical and the social barriers for 
marginalized users to participate. For example, although alt-text for user uploaded images was not typically part 
of any accessibility requirements, the abundance of images created a huge barrier for people with visual 
impairments to participate on social media, therefore we need to find <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook">creative ways</a> 
to include <em>everyone</em> in visual communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Envision and invent</em> <strong><em>new</em></strong> <em>technologies centered on the needs and empowerments of marginalized populations</em>.</p>
<p>While it is important to make existing technologies inclusive and equitable, it is equally (if not more) valuable 
to challenge the norms and assumptions embedded within current technical systems and create new technologies 
representing the needs and values of marginalized populations. For example, I worked with my intern, <a href="https://www.yuhangz.com/">Yuhang Zhao</a>, to 
design and evaluate <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/a-face-recognition-application-for-people-with-visual-impairments-understanding-use-beyond-the-lab/">an experimental face recognition tool</a> 
for people with visual impairments to recognize others in their environments. Technologies like this 
not only solve a practical problem for people from marginalized communities, but also push on greater equity issues
in our society. For example, while people with visual impairments were acutely aware of the privacy concerns by sighted people, 
their voices had been largely neglected from the debate about real-time face recognition; as a result, 
needs and rights of people with visual impairments to access to visual information were marginalized 
in a society where technology is catered to those who already had more rights and access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I had been a staff research scientist at Facebook from 2013 to 2021, leading and driving various "tech for good" initiatives from Accessibility, AI for Inclusion, to Equity. I spent most of my time at Facebook researching and building AI-powered product experiences that empower users from marginalized and under-resourced communities. One example of such experiences is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook">automatic alt-text</a>, a feature I <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/automatic-alt-text-computer-generated-image-descriptions-for-blind-users-on-a-social-network-service/">designed</a> and <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/04/04/ios/under-the-hood-building-accessibility-tools-for-the-visually-impaired-on-facebook/">shipped</a> on Facebook that leverages computer vision to describes images to people with visual impairments. I also worked with people with <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/im-never-happy-with-what-i-write-challenges-and-strategies-of-people-with-dyslexia-on-social-media/">dyslexia</a> to build <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/design-and-evaluation-of-a-social-media-writing-support-tool-for-people-with-dyslexia/">AI-powered writing tools</a> to support them to write more confidently on social media. My most recent work centers on the experiences of vulnerable populations online, such as, people with limited literacy skills and Black people in the US. My work uncovered and diagnosed disparities in their social media experiences and led to the design and development of new product features to address such disparities.</p>
<p>I publish my work at CHI, theWebConf (formerly known as WWW), CSCW, and ICWSM. I frequently review papers and serve in the organization committee for journals and conferences as well. </p>
<p>Prior to Facebook, I received my Ph.D in Information Science from Cornell University, where I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmacy14/home">Michael Macy</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/">Jon Kleinberg</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~danco/">Dan Cosley</a> on characterizing and modeling the spread of information and behaviors in large social networks. My research and working styles are also heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.ladamic.com/">Lada Adamic</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/">Phoebe Sengers</a>, both world-class computer scientists but with very different research interests and methodologies - I am grateful for their mentorship and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/Teaching/INFO6341/index.php">teaching</a>.</p>
