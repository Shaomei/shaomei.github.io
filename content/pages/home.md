I'm Shaomei. I design and build AI experiences that dismantle barriers and enable access for all. My current work sits at the intersetion of AI, HCI, Accessibility, and Social Computing. In particular, I work with **marginalized and vulneral populations** to understand unique experiences and challenges for different communities, and design technologies that empower people through those challenges.

<!-- I am interested at understanding the **experiences and challenges of marginalized communities** and building **inclusive** and **empowering** technologies **with the community**.-->

My current areas of research include:

  1. **Computational Social Science**, with a focus on the marginalized, vulnerable populations on social media. I work to understand and improve the experiences and challenges of marginalized communities on social media platforms, through qualitative and quantative research and computational methods. Most of the topics I have been working on - e.g. accessibility, gender inequality, racial justice, literacy - are complex societal challenges with deep sociocultural roots and I do not expect them to be solved by technology alone. However, I do believe that online activities and social media data can offer us new perspectives and understanding of these challenges that uncover opportunities where carefully designed technologies can make an meaningful impact. In particular, I have been and will be eager to explore:

    - How marginalized and minority groups form communities and build collective consciousness online.

    - Where are the [gaps in online experiences](https://research.fb.com/publications/visually-impaired-users-on-an-online-social-network/) and how they linked to gaps in offline outcomes for people from different social groups. 

    - How to make information and services accessible for all? Meeting the W3C accessibility standards is the first step but also a minimal requirement, we need to both empower under-priviledged groups with knowledge and resources but also design information systems that meet users with their indivisualized needs. 

  2. **AI for Empowerment & Equity**: Design and develop AI products and experiences that center on the needs of the marginalized. Deliver tangible benefits and reduce the barrier for participation for those who had been under-served and oppressed. 

    - AI & accessibility: Augment AI technology with human abilities to empower people with disabilities to fully participate in and contribute to all aspects of the society without existing physical/mental/societal bariiers. And the [challenges](https://research.fb.com/publications/a-face-recognition-application-for-people-with-visual-impairments-understanding-use-beyond-the-lab/) with (re)designing and reappropriating mainstream AI models for accessibility use case.. 
     
	 <!-- I also consider accessibility at a broader sense beyond disabilities, and interested at building technologies that dismantle all barriers for everyone to participate. -->

    - Human-centric AI: How to engage and incentivize the deep learning community to practice and appreciate participatory design and community experience research in the development cycle of AI and stop equivalizing people as labels or embeddings.



I had been a staff research scientist at Facebook. I founded and led the AI for Inclusion initiative inside the [Society and AI Lab](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/) (SAIL) at Facebook AI, through which I researched and built AI-powered product experiences that empower users from marginalized and under-resourced communities. One example of such experiences is [automatic alt-text](https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook), a feature I [designed](https://research.fb.com/publications/automatic-alt-text-computer-generated-image-descriptions-for-blind-users-on-a-social-network-service/) and [shipped](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/04/04/ios/under-the-hood-building-accessibility-tools-for-the-visually-impaired-on-facebook/) on Facebook that leverages computer vision to describes images to people with visual impairments. I also worked with people with [dyslexia](https://research.fb.com/publications/im-never-happy-with-what-i-write-challenges-and-strategies-of-people-with-dyslexia-on-social-media/) to build [AI-powered writing tools](https://research.fb.com/publications/design-and-evaluation-of-a-social-media-writing-support-tool-for-people-with-dyslexia/) to support them to write more confidently on social media. My most recent work centers on the experiences of vulnerable populations online, such as, people with limited literacy skills and Black people in the US. My work uncovered and diagnosed disparities in their social media experiences and led to the design and development of new product features to address such disparities.

Before joining Facebook AI, I was part of Facebook's Core Data Science team where I researched temporal and structural models to predict how information and behavior spread in social networks. 


I am a big fan of mixed methodology and embrace both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My current research takes place at the intersection of AI and HCI, as I believe AI research should be user/problem oriented rather than technology oriented.


I publish my work at CHI, theWebConf (formerly known as WWW), CSCW, and ICWSM. I frequently review papers and serve in the organization committee for journals and conferences as well.


I received my PhD in Information Science from Cornell University, advised by [Michael Macy](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmacy14/home), [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), and [Dan Cosley](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~danco/). I am also heavily influenced by [Lada Adamic](http://www.ladamic.com/) and [Phoebe Sengers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/), both world-class computer scientists but with very different research interests and methodologies - I am grateful for their mentorship and [teaching](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/sengers/Teaching/INFO6341/index.php).
