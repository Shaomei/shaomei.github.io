            <p>Hi, I'm Shaomei Wu. I study, design, and build technologies with marginalized communities to dismantle barriers and seek social justice. My work takes place at the intersection of community, technology, and advocacy, and I am particularly interested in understanding and challenging structural marginalization materialized through current and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>I am a fan of <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a>‘s <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/TAPP-Afsaneh_Design%20From%20the%20Margins_Final_220514.pdf">Design From the Margins</a> approach and frequently shift my focus between community research, intervention development, and social advocacy, depending on the needs of the community and the stage of the engagement. My current work looks into <a href="https://www.shaomei.info/pdfs/Stuttering_VC_preprint.pdf">stuttering and telecommunication technologies</a>, investigating the experiences and challenges of people who stutter with telecommunication technologies such as videoconferencing tools and speech AI products. </p>
<p>My work has been supported by NSF's Responsible Design, Development, and Deployment of Technologies (ReDDDoT) program (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2427710">Award #2427710</a>).</p>
<p>To learn more about my prior and ongoing projects, please check out my <a href="http://www.shaomei.info/pages/curriculum-vitae.html">CV</a>, my list of <a href="http://www.shaomei.info/pages/publications.html">selected publications</a>, my work at <a href="https://aimpower.org">AImpower.org</a>, and my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0xVWqYAAAAJ">Google Scholar Page</a>.</p>
<!--I'm Shaomei. I study, design and build technologies with marginalized communities to dismantle barriers and seek social justice. My current work takes place at the intersetion of AI, HCI, and Accessibility, and centers around the lived experiences of communities that have been structurally marginalized and impacted by technologies. In particular, I explore the following two connected domains:
-->

<!-- I am interested at understanding the **experiences and challenges of marginalized communities** and building **inclusive** and **empowering** technologies **with the community**.-->
<!--
  1. **Understand marginalized communities and their experiences online and offline**.

    Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methodology, I study the *challenges* and 
    *capacities* of marginalized communities, and identify *opportunities* for technology to make a 
    meaningful impact on people’s lives.

    - **Challenges** - *Where are the gaps in technological experiences for marginalized users and how are these gaps linked to offline 
    experiences and outcomes*? 

    - **Capacities** - *How do marginalized and underserved users leverage and reappropriate mainstream technology to build communities, foster collective consciousness, and coordinate resistance to existing power structures*?

    - **Opportunities** - *What are the opportunities for current and future technology to close the equity gaps online and offline*? 

  2. **Co-design socio-technical solutions with the community to deliver tangible benefits and level the playing field**.

     Informed by the knowledge from the previous domain, I also do lots of hand-on design & development work in building tools and socio-technical infrastructures  that empower people to overcome barriers and pursue their goals. My tech work falls into the following two areas:

    - *Make* ***existing*** *technologies inclusive for all, pushing the envelope of accessibility beyond checklists and government requirements*.

    - *Envision and invent* ***new*** *technologies centered on the empowerments of marginalized populations, leveling the playing field and lifting up those who were historically left behind*.

<p>Shaomei Wu is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://aimpower.org">AImpower.org</a>, a tech non-profit that researches and co-creates empowering technologies <em>for</em> and <em>with</em> marginalized communities. Previously, Shaomei was a staff research scientist at Facebook and Instagram, leading and driving various "tech for good" initiatives to research and create accessible, equitable, and empowering social media experiences for marginalized and low-resourced communitie. One of such experiences is <a href="https://tech.fb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/06/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook/">automatic alt-text</a>, a computer-vision powered service that describes images on Facebook and Instagram to people with visual impairments in real time. Prior to Facebook, Shaomei received her Ph.D in Information Science from Cornell University, studying the spread of information and behaviors in large social networks. Shaomei publishes her work in HCI, accessibility, and Computational Social Sciences venues such as CHI, CSCW, theWebConf, and ICWSM.</p>
<p>Shaomei is a person who stutters and is still exploring this part of her identity. She volunteers her time and experience mentoring students and junior researchers from underrepresented groups, organizing academic conferences and workshops on equity and accessibility topics, and supporting other nonprofit community organizations as their technical mentor and advisor.</p>

Shaomei Wu is the founder and CEO of [AImpower.org](https://aimpower.org), a tech non-profit that researches and co-creates technologies for and with marginalized communities to dismantle barriers and deliver tangible benefits. Previously, Shaomei was a staff research scientist at Facebook and Instagram, leading and driving various "tech for good" initiatives from Accessibility, AI for Inclusion, to Equity. Throughout her career, Shaomei worked closely with users from marginalized and/or low-resource communities - such as people with disabilities, people with limited literacy skills, and racial minorities in the US - to understand their technology experiences and build AI-powered products to meet their needs. One of such products is [automatic alt-text](https://tech.fb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/06/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook/), a computer-vision powered service that describes images on Facebook and Instagram to screen readers in real time. Prior to Facebook, Shaomei received her Ph.D in Information Science from Cornell University, studying the spread of information and behaviors in large social networks. Shaomei publishes her work in HCI, accessibility, and Computational Social Sciences venues such as CHI, CSCW, theWebConf, and ICWSM. 

Shaomei is a person who stutters and is still exploring this part of her identity. She frequently volunteers her time mentoring students and junior researchers from underrepresented groups, organizing academic conferences, and sharing her technical expertise with other nonprofit organizations.
